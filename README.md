This project predicts whether a person is suffering from Pnemonia or not by analyzing their Chest X-Ray images. It implements Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
for classification. The Dataset has been taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/coronahack-chest-xraydataset). The project has various sections such as 
Mounting Drive, Using Kaggle, Data Loading and Preprocessing and Convolutional Neural Networks.
